    <hr />
    <p>Hi, <b>I am a web developer</b>.A web developer is a programmer who specializes in building websites using coding and programming languages 1. They are responsible for creating the website’s structure, writing code, and verifying that the code works. Web developers often work alongside web designers or marketing teams to ensure the website is well-designed and easy to navigate 1. Web developers are responsible for the website’s performance and capacity. They specialize in different areas, and large web projects are usually a collaboration between several different developers 1. A web developer is not to be confused with a web designer, who only deals with the aesthetics of a website or application 1</p>
